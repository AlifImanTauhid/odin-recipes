# My First Web Project

Welcome to my first web project! This is a simple static website created using basic HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s a great starting point to get familiar with web development fundamentals.

## Project Overview

This project consists of a single HTML page styled with CSS. The main goal was to learn and practice:

 - Basic HTML structure
 - CSS styling and layout techniques

Files Included:
    
 - index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
 - styles.css: The CSS file used to style the webpage.
