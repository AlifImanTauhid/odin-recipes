    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bananas: Usually, pisang kepok (cooking bananas) or pisang raja (banana cultivar with a firmer texture) are used. These are peeled and sliced.</li>
        <li>Coconut Milk: Thick coconut milk is used to create a creamy base for the dessert.</li>
        <li>Palm Sugar (Gula Melaka): This gives the dessert its characteristic sweetness and caramel-like flavor. It's usually grated or chopped before use.</li>
        <li>Pandan Leaves: These are optional but add a subtle, fragrant flavor to the dish. They are tied into a knot or folded to release their aroma during cooking.</li>
        <li>Water: Used to thin out the coconut milk and create the sauce.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Prepare the Ingredients</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and slice the bananas into rounds.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cooking Process</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine coconut milk, water, and palm sugar. Stir over medium heat until the palm sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Add Bananas and Pandan Leaves</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the sliced bananas and pandan leaves (if using) to the saucepan. Stir gently to combine.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Simmer</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over low to medium heat. Cook until the bananas are tender and the flavors have melded, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the banana slices.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Serve</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Once the bananas are cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly, remove from heat.</li>

    </ol>
