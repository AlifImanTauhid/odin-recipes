    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Prepare the broth</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a bit of cooking oil in a pot over medium heat. Sauté the minced garlic and shallots until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add galangal, ginger, lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves. Sauté for another minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in water, sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), and the dissolved tamarind paste. Bring to a boil.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook noodles and topings</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>While the broth is simmering, prepare the noodles according to package instructions. Usually, they need to be blanched in boiling water for a few minutes until tender. Drain and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Blend the broth</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Once the broth has boiled and the flavors have melded together (about 10-15 minutes), remove the lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves. Transfer the broth to a blender and add toasted shrimp paste. Blend until smooth. If you prefer a chunkier broth, you can skip blending.</li>
