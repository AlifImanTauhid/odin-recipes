    <h3>Descriptions</h3>
    <p>Nasi goreng is a popular Indonesian dish that translates to "fried rice" in English. It is made from pre-cooked rice stir-fried with a combination of ingredients such as shallots, garlic, shrimp paste, chili, soy sauce, and often includes additional ingredients like vegetables, chicken, prawns, or eggs. The dish is typically seasoned with kecap manis (sweet soy sauce) which gives it a slightly sweet flavor.</p>
    <p>Nasi goreng is known for its versatility and is often served with accompaniments such as fried eggs, prawn crackers (krupuk), sliced cucumber, and a wedge of lime. It's a staple food in Indonesian cuisine and can be found at street food stalls, restaurants, and households throughout Indonesia and neighboring countries like Malaysia and Singapore.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>If using fresh rice, cook it ahead of time and allow it to cool completely or use leftover rice from the day before, which works best.</li>
        <li>Dice the protein (chicken, shrimp, beef) into bite-sized pieces. If using tofu, cut into cubes.</li>
        <li>Mince garlic, slice shallots, and onion</li>
        <li>Chop vegetables into small pieces.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Heat the Pan</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook the Protein</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the diced protein (chicken, shrimp, beef, tofu) to the pan. Stir-fry until cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook the Aromatics</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed. Add minced garlic, sliced shallots, and onion. Stir-fry until fragrant and the onions are translucent.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Add Vegetables</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the chopped vegetables to the pan. Stir-fry for a few minutes until they start to soften but still have a slight crunch.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Add Rice</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the cooked rice to the pan. Break up any clumps and stir-fry with the vegetables until the rice is heated through and evenly coated with the aromatics and oil.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Seasoning</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Drizzle soy sauce, sweet soy sauce/kecap manis, fish sauce, and oyster sauce over the rice. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mix well to combine and evenly distribute the sauces.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Add Protein Back In</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Return the cooked protein (chicken, shrimp, beef, tofu) to the pan. Stir-fry for another minute or two to heat the protein through and allow the flavors to meld.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Eggs</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Push the rice mixture to one side of the pan. Crack eggs into the empty side of the pan. Scramble or fry the eggs until cooked to your liking.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Combine and Serve</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the scrambled/fried eggs into the rice mixture. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, garnished with optional crispy fried shallots or garlic, and accompanied by lime wedges, cucumber slices, or other preferred sides.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use leftover rice: Leftover rice works best because it's drier and less sticky, making it easier to fry without clumping.</li>
        <li>High heat: Stir-fry over medium-high to high heat to achieve that characteristic smoky flavor and to prevent the rice from becoming mushy.</li>
        <li>Customize: Feel free to adjust the ingredients and seasonings based on your taste preferences. Nasi goreng is versatile and can accommodate various proteins and vegetables.</li>
    </ul>
